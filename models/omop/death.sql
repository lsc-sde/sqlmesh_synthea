-- NB:
-- We observe death records in both the encounters.csv and observations.csv file.
-- To find the death records in observations, use code = '69453-9'. This is a LOINC code
-- that represents an observation of the US standard certificate of death.  To find the
-- corresponding cause of death, we would need to join to conditions on patient and description
-- (specifically conditions.description = observations.value).  Instead, we can use the encounters table.
-- Encounters.code = '308646001' is the SNOMED observation of death certification.
-- The reasoncode column is the SNOMED code for the condition that caused death, so by using encounters
-- we get both the code for the death certification and the corresponding cause of death.
